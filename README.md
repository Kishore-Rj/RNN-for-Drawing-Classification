# RNN-for-Drawing-Classification

• Building a RNN model which recognizes the object category that the user tries to draw using the user input, given as a sequence of strokes of points in x and y co-ordinates 

• The model uses a combination of convolutional, LSTM and softmax output layers to classify the drawings
